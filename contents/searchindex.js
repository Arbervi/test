"\t\t\n1 Introduction\nPurpose and Contents\nThe Nintendo Dev Interface (NDI) is software designed to manage the installation and updating of Nintendo developer software. Instead of downloading individual packages, you can now select a set of package choices and the packages are correctly installed. Dependencies between packages are automatically handled by NDI and only appropriate packages are selected.\nThis document discusses the Nintendo Dev Interface Graphical User Interface.\nNotes\nAuthorization\nMany features of NDI can only be used while connected to the Nintendo Developer Portal (https://developer.nintendo.com), which requires an active Nintendo Developer ID.\nTo create a Nintendo Developer ID , please follow the instructions at https://developer.nintendo.com/register.\nAntivirus\nNDI downloads and installs files to your PC, because of this, some antivirus software programs may identify NDI as malicious software. To prevent this, please add NDI as an exception in your antivirus software. Refer to your antivirus software documentation for instructions on how to add an exception.\nSystem Requirements\n \tMicrosoft Windows 7 64-bit Operating System with Service Pack 1 or Microsoft Windows 10 RTM Operating System\n \tMinimum Display resolution of 1366x768\n \tAdministrator Rights\nCONFIDENTIAL\n",0,"en-US"]

"\t\t\n2 NDI Installation and Configuration\nInstallation\nThe NDI installer is available for download from the Nintendo Developer Portal Downloads page. After downloading the installer, run the included setup executable and follow the on-screen instructions to install NDI.\n Note\n While upgrading to a newer version of NDI is possible, it is not possible to downgrade to a previous version without uninstalling NDI completely.\nSettings\nWhen the application starts, you are presented with the NDI splash-screen and the Welcome screen.\nThe Welcome screen displays the tools that you can interact with to assist in development. However, it is recommended that you first access the Settings menu and configure the application for your needs.\n Info\n The first time you run NDI, you are automatically taken to the settings screen as you progress through the application.\nTo access the Settings menu, click the gear icon in the upper right of the window.\nThis list contains four options:\n \t Settings: Opens the settings menu.\n \t Documentation: Opens the directory where the NDI documentation is located.\n \t About: Displays information about NDI and contact information.\n \t Sign In / Sign Out: On first run, displays as Sign In and allows you to log in to the Nintendo Developer Portal with a Nintendo Developer ID. After a sign in has occurred, it changes to Sign Out. When Sign Out is selected, you are disconnected from the Nintendo Developer Portal.\nClick Settings to open a window with the following tabs.\nApplication Tab\nThe Application tab allows you to configure elements of NDI. The options are as follows.\n \t User interface language: Changes the display language of NDI.\n \t Send app usage data to Nintendo: If enabled, usage data is reported to Nintendo to allow the support and improvement of NDI. The Nintendo Privacy Notice link opens a page that provides further details.\n \t Enable network proxy server authentication: If enabled, when authentication with a proxy server is required, NDI saves the required information for future authentications. When NDI is started for the first time, this option is selected.\n \t Enable unsafe package selection: If enabled, you are able to select packages that are not suitable or compatible with other selected packages when creating and updating environments. Unsafe package selection is occasionally used for specific high-risk installation scenarios. An unsafe selection may lead to unstable environments or data, it is not recommended to select this option.\n \t Prompt before closing application: If enabled, a message displays on exiting the program that confirms the closing action.\n \t Keep application running in system tray: If enabled, when NDI is closed using the close button in the upper right corner of the application window, the application minimizes to the system tray.\n \t Manifest language: Software package descriptions are displayed in the selected language, if available.\nDev Environments Tab\nThe Dev Environments tab allows you to configure how environments are installed through NDI. The options are as follows.\n \t Cache Location: The directory where files downloaded by the client are located.\n \t Current cache size: Displays the total size of all files in the current Cache Location.\n \t Limit cache size: If enabled, NDI controls the maximum amount of data that can be in the NDI cache. The slider to the right of the option determines the maximum size of the cache. Each time NDI is started while this option is enabled, files are removed from the cache until the total size of all files in the cache is below the selected value. Files are removed from oldest to newest.\n \t Keep locally cached files: If enabled, files that are downloaded remain in the cache after NDI is closed.\n \t View Cache: Opens the directory specified by Cache Location.\n \t Copy latest manifest to cache: Creates a copy of the current manifest file in the current cache location.\nThe purpose of the cache is to save files after download so that they can be used to create environments at a later time. The cache location may be changed to another disk drive or partition that may have more storage space, separate from the location of installed files or environments.\nComponents Tab\nThe Components tab contains a list of NDI modules that are available on the currently connected server, and any modules that have previously been installed. Installed modules provide additional features to NDI, based on the individual module selected. To make selections, install, or reinstall these modules, select the appropriate option from the drop-down list box on the right and select Execute updates. In most cases, you should restart NDI after completing this process.\n Note\n The Components tab is only accessible when the Settings menu is opened from the Welcome screen.\nRequired Components\nSome components allow NDI to function correctly or provide additional features to the application. These required components are downloaded automatically when connected to the server and are indicated when they are installed. Required components are displayed on the Components tab, but can not be uninstalled.\nSaving\nAfter you have confirmed your settings, click the Save button in the lower right to return to the main application. To make changes to your settings, you can return to the Settings menu on any screen where the gear icon is blue.\nYou can now begin using the Nintendo Dev Interface.\nCONFIDENTIAL\n",0,"en-US"]

This screen displays information on currently installed environments and allows you to update packages already installed to those environments.\nThe Development Environments screen allows you to create, update, modify, and delete environments. An environment is the location on your machine where NDI install files to. You may have more than one environment on your PC, each with a different set of packages.\nWhen no environments are present on your system (as is the case the when you first install NDI), instead of the Development Environments screen, you will be taken directly to the Install New Environment screen, as shown below.\nThe options available from this screen are as follows.\n \t Create My Own: Allows you to create a custom environment using packages downloaded through your NDID account.\n \t Create From Archive: Allows you to create an exact copy of another environment (created by you or another user), which is defined by a MegaZarf file.\nCONFIDENTIAL\n",0,"en-US"]
,["Pages/Page_204982399.html","3.1.1 Environment Destination",
"\t\t\n3.1.1 Environment Destination\nNavigating the Environment Destination Screen\nThis screen is used to determine how NDI should proceed with environment installations. Two options are detailed below.\nInstall To Disk\n If you select this option, NDI guides you through the process of installing an environment to your development system, based on your specifications.\n Install To Archive\n If you select this option, NDI assists you in creating a MegaZarf for a new environment. A MegaZarf is a file that contains all the information necessary to recreate that Environment in the future. MegaZarf files enable users to consistently and reliably recreate a development environment on any computer that is capable of running NDI. This option does not install any software to your development system.\n Note\n The following section of this manual assumes that you are using the Install To Disk option. For more information about creating an archive, see the Install To Archive section at the end of this page.\n Logging in\nWhen navigating to either option, if you have not logged into a server previously or if this is your first time running the application, you are presented with a Connect to Nintendo Server dialog box as shown below.\nThe fields in this dialog box are as follows.\n \t Server: The server that NDI accesses when downloading packages. Generally, you select the Nintendo Developer Portal.\n \t Nintendo Developer ID: Your valid NDID username.\n \t Password: Your valid password for the indicated NDID account.\nTo continue, select a server and enter your NDID credentials. If you do not have an NDID account, for more information, contact your regional Nintendo developer support group.\nYou can also allow the application to remember your information for future connections. If you would rather the application not save this information, uncheck the Remember Credentials check box.\nAfter entering your credentials, click Connect to continue to the next screen.\n Info\n You do not need to be connected to create an environment using a MegaZarf that contains all the required files to install it (often indicated by the name of the MegaZarf or a large file size), or to perform most actions when managing existing environments. If an action would require a connection to complete, the Connect to Nintendo Server dialog box will appear if you are not already connected.\n After successfully connecting to a server, if your current version of NDI is not the latest version available you will be prompted to upgrade. Server authentication will complete after the upgrade is applied. It is possible to decline an upgrade, but you will not be able to authenticate with the server until the upgrade is completed.\nCreating an Environment\n1. Define New Environment\nIn this step, you select the hardware platform, foundation, and (optionally) an additional tool set that determines which software packages you are able to install to the environment you are creating.\n Platform\n Select the hardware platform that you want the environment to develop for. Your selection of platform determines what tool sets and foundations you can choose for your environment.\n Tool Set\n Tool Sets are complementary files that may be installed alongside the foundation that you choose, such as Unity, Visual Studio support, or Nintendo Web Framework. Your choice of tool set determines what foundations are available for your environment.\n Info\n Only one tool set may be added to each environment.\n You may also choose not to install any additional tool sets by selecting the Standard option.\n Info\n Some platform selections may not support additional tool sets.\n When you click Next, the Choose Location screen is displayed.\nFoundation\nAfter selecting your platform and tool set (if applicable), you are able to select a foundation package that is compatible with both of your previous choices.\n2. Select SDK Version\nIn this step, you select the version of the foundation to be installed. Depending on the platform and foundation combination you previously selected, one of two different selection methods are displayed. If there are add-on packages for the selected platform that correspond to the selected foundation, a version list for each add-on package is displayed. This allows you to select a version of each add-on package and prevents you from selecting any that conflict with each other. Click on the question mark icon next to a selection to display a description for that version.\n Info\n Making a selection does not prevent you from changing the selection later in the environment creation process.\nIf there are no additional add-ons for the platform and foundation you selected, a list of foundation versions to choose from is displayed. Click on the question mark icon to display a description and any important notes about each selection.\n Info\n On occasion, only one version of a foundation will be available. In such a case, no selection menu will be shown and information about the version will be displayed automatically.\n When you click Next, the Choose Location screen is displayed.\n Note\n If Install to Archive was selected on the Environment Destination screen, the Configure Environment screen will be displayed instead.\n3. Choose Location\nIn this step, you enter the base installation directory for the environment that you want to create. The fields are as follows.\n \t Location: The directory location where the environment is created.\n \t Name: The name that the environment is referred to by NDI.\n Info\n \tAn ideal name for your environment may be one that is similar to the project you are working on. You should not use a name based on the version of an SDK you are installing. This is because when you update it in the future, the version number of the SDK will change.\n \tTwo environments with the same name cannot reside in the same location.\n \tThe final installation path for the environment is a combination of the Location and Name fields. The Location is used as the base path, and the Name is used as an additional path underneath the Location. For example, an environment with the Name Environment and the Location C:\\NDI_Environments, would have an installation path of C:\\NDI_Environments\\Environment.\nIf there is a conflict with the name of the environment entered, an error message appears informing you of the issue.\n4. Configure Environment\nIn this step, you choose the software packages that are installed when initially creating your environment. Not all packages are required, and you may choose to install other packages at a later time. You can select packages in two different ways: by Bundle Selection or through Detailed Package Management.\nBundle Selection\nInitially, you are presented with the Bundle Selection screen, as shown below.\nThe individual selections on this screen represent software packages that have been grouped together for a specific purpose. This might be because they are useful to a particular development role, such as Artist or Tester, or because the software has interdependent features. These bundles are intended to help you make selections of the packages you wish to install. You may select any combination of bundles, or one bundle individually, to suit your development needs. Click a bundle to select or deselect it.\nClick the Details link to open a window with more information on the software packages that are included in the bundle.\nClick the Next button in the lower right corner to display a list of all packages that have been selected, including file size. From this screen, click Install to begin installation of all packages from the selected bundles. If no bundles are selected, only the software packages required by the foundation and tool set (if applicable) are installed.\n Detailed Package Management\n Instead of installing packages based on bundles, you can make choices about the packages that will be installed to your environment. To start this process, click the Detailed Package Management button. Any packages belonging to bundles that have been selected, will automatically be set to install on the following package selection screen. For more information about detailed package selection, see the 3.1.4 Custom Package Selection section.\n EULA\n Some packages selected for installation have an End User License Agreement (EULA) that you will need to review. The EULAs are displayed when you click Install and must be accepted for the associated software to begin installation. After a package has been installed, you only need to accept the EULA again if you delete the software from all environments on your system.\n5. Installing Packages\nWhen you have specified the packages that you want to install, the download and installation process begins.\nThe download process indicates the progress of individual packages as they are downloaded from the server. Packages that have been previously downloaded and saved to the cache will not be redownloaded. The following is a screen that shows the beginning of the download process.\nAfter all packages have been downloaded, they are then installed. The following is a screen showing that packages have started installing while others are still waiting to be installed.\nWhen all packages have finished installing, the Finish button becomes selectable. Click Finish to return to the Welcome screen.\nInstall to Archive\nIf you have chosen to create a MegaZarf archive, you are presented with the following screen.\nIn this step, you enter information about the MegaZarf file that will be created. A MegaZarf file contains all the information required for any instance of NDI to recreate the environment it contains.\nTo create a MegaZarf, the following information must be provided.\n \t Export File Name: The name for the MegaZarf file.\n \t Export Path: The location on the file system that the MegaZarf is saved to.\n \t Description: A text description that is included with the MegaZarf file.\n \t Include all software binaries in the exported file: If checked, the MegaZarf contains all files to build the contained environment while offline. This greatly increases the file size of the MegaZarf, based on the number and size of packages in the environment. If unchecked, only the metadata required to create the environment is exported. In this case, NDI may prompt consumers of the MegaZarf to connect to Nintendo to download the files required for installation.\n \t Environment Name: The name of the environment that is being created.\n \t Allow overriding name: If checked, a user that creates an environment from the MegaZarf is able to choose a different name for the environment than the one you specify.\n \t Environment Location: The file system location of the environment that is being created.\n \t Allow overriding path location: If checked, a user that creates an environment from this MegaZarf is able to choose another directory location to install the environment than the one you specify.\nAfter entering all required information, click Next in the lower right corner to continue. For more information, return to step 1 Define New Environment earlier in this section.

Typical error messages may be similar to: \"Download failed\", \"Install failed\", and \"Failed to create installation environment\". If these error messages appear, you could be running out of disk space for your cache or space for your environment.\n Solution: Create more space on your storage device. Change the location of your cache folder. Change the location of your environment.\n Authentication Errors\n For security reasons, Nintendo ensures that only authorized users can install development packages. For this reason, you must have a correct NDID and password. You can learn more about authentication at the Nintendo Developer Portal. Typical error messages may be similar to \"The authentication mode provided is not valid\", \"Failed to set user name\", \"Failed to set password\", or \"Unable to authenticate with server\".\n Solution: Make sure that you have the correct user name and password. Your company has a Company Admin who is authorized to provide user names and passwords by accessing the Nintendo Developer Portal. If you have forgotten your password, you can reset it from the Nintendo Developer Portal.\n Environment Errors\n When setting up an installation, you must choose an environment. The environment consists of two parts. You must first select a folder on your hard drive. The location of your folder is named the install location. The install location must be a valid folder and have enough space to hold the package files to be installed. In addition, you must give your environment an environment name. This can be any name unique to the specified install location. Typical error messages may be similar to: \"Invalid location\" or \"Invalid name\" You may also get errors similar to the errors listed in the Storage Errors section above.\n Solution: Make sure you have a valid install location and environment name, and that you have enough space for large installs now and in the future. An environment can have as many package versions in an environment as hard disk space allows. It may be difficult to move your environment to another disk. Environment names cannot have spaces in them.\n Hardware Errors\n When performing a hardware update, a number of different errors can occur. There are a few troubleshooting solutions that you can attempt.\n Solution: Upon observing an error, exit NDI, then directly connect to the hardware device using the diagnostic tools provided with your SDK (such as Target Manager). For further assistance with hardware diagnostic tools, consult the documentation for your specific hardware and SDK.\n If your hardware update problems persist, please refer to the SDK documentation or contact Nintendo support.\nCONFIDENTIAL\n",0,"en-US"]

"\t\t\n5 Glossary\n When using Nintendo Dev Interface, familiarize yourself with the following terms.\n Bundle\n A bundle is a collection of packages that, for ease of installation, can be selected at the same time. These collections often represent software packages applicable to different development team roles, such as Software Developer, Artist, or Tester. They may also be software packages that have interdependent features that function best when installed together.\n Component\n A component is a software package that is used by NDI to provide additional functionality for the application. Components take two forms: Required Components, which are automatically downloaded and installed when connecting to a server, and Optional Components, which can be installed through the Components tab of the settings window.\n Environment\n An environment refers to a specific installation of software and the folder that it resides in. Each environment is independent of other environments. That is, the operations performed on one environment do not affect other environments. The number of environments you can have is mainly limited by the amount of hard disk space available. Environments must be unique only in name; they do not have to be unique in their contents. Therefore, you can have multiple environments installed (each with the same SDK and other set of software). After an environment is created, you cannot remove items from it. You can, however, update its internal software and add new software that you may have skipped during the initial installation.\n Family\n A family is a container that holds specifically-purposed software; similar to a container for a concept.\n For example, the Wii U platform contains families representing the following concepts:\n \tConcept \tFamily Name\n \tC / C++ Software Development Kit for Wii U \tCafe SDK\n \tCPU Profiler \tWii U CPU Profiler\n \tDevice driver for PC <-> CAT-DEV communication \tHostBridge\n Within a family, there may be one or more \"releases\". For information on releases, see below.\n Foundation\n A release that can be the core package for an environment. This package determines which packages are available for installation.\n Global Package\n A release that can only be installed one time per machine. Examples: Unity, HostBridge, Havok.\n Manifest\n The file from the current server that indicates the data that you have access to.\n MegaZarf\n A file containing the information needed to recreate a specific environment. Depending on how the file was created, it may additionally contain the data required to create the environment without requiring you to connect to a server.\n Package\n A release that can be installed multiple times on a single machine, but one time per environment. Examples: NintendoSDK, VoiceChat, NEX.\n Release\n A release refers to a specific variant of software within a family. Each release is associated with a particular version number or release date, language or locale (for example, the documentation in the release, the text emitted by the tools or program, etc), target operating region (US, EU, JP, etc), and other such attributes. For example, the NintendoSDK 1.0.0 (English) would be a release in the NintendoSDK family, while the NintendoSDK 1.0.0 (Japanese) would be a separate release.\n Rollback\n A rollback operation can be performed on specific packages (usually NintendoSDK and related packages) and reverts the last update to the package, returning to the the previous state that the package was in. If multiple updates have been made to an individual package, you will be able to rollback the package until it reverts to the original installation. Because changes made to these packages are recorded when updating, performing a rollback restores all of these changes, allowing you to safely determine if updating the packages will negatively affect your development environment.\nCONFIDENTIAL\n",0,"en-US"]
