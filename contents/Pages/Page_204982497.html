<p class="p">Installation of packages onto your PC, or updates to your development hardware, can involve many possible configurations, because of this, NDI&nbsp;takes care to ensure that your installation is successful. However, certain errors may still occur and this section&nbsp;attempts to inform you on how to best address these issues.</p>
<div class="info_new">
  <div class="info_new_left">Info</div>
  <div class="info_new_right">
    <p>In the event an error requires and you to send information to Nintendo for assistance, a logging file will be created in the Application Data directory (by default: C:\Users\&lt;Profile&gt;\AppData\Local\Nintendo\NDI).</p>

<div class="section">
  <h2 id="Anchor_204982497_h2_1">Storage Errors</h2>
  <p class="p">An error that&nbsp;you may encounter is not having enough storage space available on a hard drive. Typical error messages may be similar to: &quot;Download failed&quot;, &quot;Install failed&quot;, and &quot;Failed to create installation environment&quot;. If these error messages appear, you could be running out of disk space for your cache or space for your environment.</p>
  <p class="p">
    <em class="ph i">Solution:&nbsp;</em>Create more space on your storage device. Change the location of your cache folder. Change the location of your environment.</p>
  <p class="p">&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <h2 id="Anchor_204982497_h2_2">Authentication Errors</h2>
  <p class="p">For security reasons, Nintendo ensures that only authorized users can install development packages. For this reason, you must have a correct NDID and password. You can learn more about authentication at the Nintendo Developer Portal. Typical error messages may be similar to &quot;The authentication mode provided is not valid&quot;, &quot;Failed to set user name&quot;, &quot;Failed to set password&quot;, or &quot;Unable to authenticate with server&quot;.</p>
  <p class="p">
    <em class="ph i">Solution:</em>&nbsp;Make sure that you have the correct user name and password. Your company has a Company Admin who is authorized to provide user names and passwords by accessing the Nintendo Developer Portal. If you have forgotten your password, you can reset it from the Nintendo Developer Portal.</p>
  <p class="p">&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <h2 id="Anchor_204982497_h2_3">Environment Errors</h2>
  <p class="p">When setting up an installation, you must choose an environment. The environment consists of two parts. You must first select a folder on your hard drive. The location of your folder is&nbsp;named the <em>install location</em>. The install location must be a valid folder and have enough space to hold the package files to be installed. In addition, you must give your environment an environment name. This can be any name unique to the specified install location. Typical error messages may be similar to: &quot;Invalid location&quot; or &quot;Invalid name&quot; You may also get errors similar to the errors listed in the Storage Errors section above.</p>
  <p>
    <em class="ph i">Solution:</em>&nbsp;Make sure you have a valid install location and environment name, and that you have enough space for large installs now and in the future. An environment can have as many package versions in an environment as hard disk space allows. It may be difficult to move your environment to another disk. Environment names cannot have spaces in them.</p>
  <h2 id="Anchor_204982497_h2_4">Hardware Errors</h2>
  <p class="p">When performing a hardware update, a number of different errors can occur. There are a few&nbsp;troubleshooting solutions that you can attempt.</p>
  <p class="p">
    <em class="ph i">Solution:&nbsp;</em>Upon&nbsp;observing an error,&nbsp;exit NDI, then directly connect to the hardware device using the diagnostic tools provided with your SDK (such as Target Manager). For further assistance with hardware diagnostic tools, consult the documentation for your specific hardware and SDK.</p>
  <p>If your hardware update problems persist, please refer to the SDK documentation or contact Nintendo support.</p>
