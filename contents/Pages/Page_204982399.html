<h2 id="Anchor_204982399_h2_1">Navigating the Environment Destination Screen</h2>
<p>This screen is used to&nbsp;determine how NDI should proceed with environment installations. Two options are detailed below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  <img src="../Attachments/Attach_204982399/246235485.png" width="500" />
</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_204982399_h3_1">Install To Disk</h3>
<div class="section">
  <p class="p">If you select this option, NDI guides you through the process of installing an environment to your development system, based on your specifications.&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="p" style="margin-left: 60.0px;">&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <h3 id="Anchor_204982399_h3_2">Install To Archive</h3>
  <p>If you select this option, NDI assists you in creating a MegaZarf for a new environment. A MegaZarf is a file that contains all the information necessary to recreate that Environment in the future. MegaZarf files enable users to consistently and reliably recreate a development environment on any computer that is capable of running NDI. &nbsp;This option&nbsp;does not install any software to your development system.&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="note_new">
    <div class="note_new_left">Note</div>
    <div class="note_new_right">
      <p>The following section of this manual assumes that you&nbsp;are using the&nbsp;<strong>Install To Disk</strong> option. For more information about creating an archive, see the <em>Install To Archive</em> section at the end of this page.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h2 id="Anchor_204982399_h2_2">Logging in</h2>
</div>
<p class="p">When navigating to either option, if you have not logged into a server previously or if this is your first time running the application, you are presented with a&nbsp;<strong class="ph b">Connect to Nintendo Server</strong>&nbsp;dialog box as&nbsp;shown below.</p>
<p class="p">
  <img src="../Attachments/Attach_204982399/246235483.png" width="500" />
</p>
<p class="p">The fields in this dialog box are as follows.</p>
<ul class="ul">
  <li class="li">
    <strong class="ph b">Server:</strong>&nbsp;The server that NDI accesses when downloading packages. Generally, you select the Nintendo Developer Portal.</li>
  <li class="li">
    <strong class="ph b">Nintendo Developer ID:</strong>&nbsp;Your valid NDID username.</li>
  <li class="li">
    <strong class="ph b">Password:</strong>&nbsp;Your valid password for the indicated NDID account.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">To continue, select a server and enter your NDID credentials. If you do not have an NDID account, for more information, contact your regional Nintendo developer support group.</p>
<p class="p">You can also allow the application to remember your information for future connections. If you would rather the application not save this information, uncheck the&nbsp;<strong class="ph b">Remember Credentials</strong>&nbsp;check box.</p>
<p class="p">After entering your credentials, click <strong class="ph b">Connect</strong>&nbsp;to continue to the next screen.</p>
<div class="info_new">
  <div class="info_new_left">Info</div>
  <div class="info_new_right">
    <p>You do not need to be connected to create an environment using a MegaZarf that contains all the required files to install it (often indicated by the name of the MegaZarf or a large file size), or to perform most actions when managing existing environments. If an action would require a connection to complete, the <strong class="ph b">Connect to Nintendo Server</strong>&nbsp;dialog box&nbsp;will appear if you are not already connected.</p>
    <p>After successfully connecting to a server, if your current version of NDI is not the latest version available you will be prompted to upgrade. Server authentication will complete after the upgrade is applied. It is possible to decline an upgrade, but you will not be able to authenticate with the server until the upgrade is completed.</p>

<h1 id="Anchor_204982399_h1_1">Creating an Environment</h1>
<h2 id="Anchor_204982399_h2_3">1. Define New Environment</h2>
<p>
  <img src="../Attachments/Attach_204982399/246235488.png" width="500" />
</p>
<p>In this step, you select the hardware platform, foundation, and (optionally) an additional tool set that determines which software packages you are&nbsp;able to install to the environment you are creating.</p>
<p class="p">&nbsp;</p>
<div class="section">
  <h3 id="Anchor_204982399_h3_3">Platform</h3>
  <p>Select the hardware platform that you want the environment to develop for. Your selection of platform determines what tool sets and foundations you can choose for your environment.</p>
  <p class="p">&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <h3 id="Anchor_204982399_h3_4">Tool Set</h3>
  <p class="p">Tool Sets are complementary files that may be installed alongside the foundation that you choose, such as Unity, Visual Studio support, or Nintendo Web Framework. Your choice of tool set determines what foundations are available for your environment.</p>
  <div class="info_new">
    <div class="info_new_left">Info</div>
    <div class="info_new_right">
      <p>Only one tool set may be added to each environment.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>You may also choose not to install any additional tool sets by selecting the <strong>Standard</strong> option.</p>
  <div class="info_new">
    <div class="info_new_left">Info</div>
    <div class="info_new_right">
      <p>Some platform selections may not support additional tool sets.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>When you click&nbsp;<strong>Next</strong>, the&nbsp;<strong>Choose Location</strong>&nbsp;screen is displayed.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="Anchor_204982399_h3_5">Foundation</h3>
<p>After selecting your platform and tool set (if applicable), you are able to select a foundation package that is compatible with both of your previous choices.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_204982399_h2_4">2. Select SDK Version</h2>
<p>
  <img src="../Attachments/Attach_204982399/246235492.png" width="500" />
</p>
<p class="p">In this step, you select the version of the foundation to be installed. Depending on the platform and foundation combination you previously selected, one of two different selection methods are displayed. If there are add-on packages for the selected platform that correspond to the selected foundation, a version list for each add-on package is displayed. This allows you to select a version of each add-on package and prevents you from selecting any that conflict with each other. Click on the question mark icon next to a selection to display a description for that version.</p>
<div class="info_new">
  <div class="info_new_left">Info</div>
  <div class="info_new_right">
    <p>Making a selection&nbsp;does not prevent you from changing the selection later in the environment creation process.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<p class="p">If there are no additional add-ons for the platform and foundation you selected, a list of foundation versions to choose from is displayed. Click on the question mark icon to display a description and any&nbsp;important notes about each selection.</p>
<div class="info_new">
  <div class="info_new_left">Info</div>
  <div class="info_new_right">
    <p>On occasion,&nbsp;only one version of a foundation will be available. In&nbsp;such a&nbsp;case, no selection menu will be shown and information about the version will be displayed automatically.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<p>
  <span class="notetitle">When you click&nbsp;<strong>Next</strong>, the&nbsp;<strong>Choose Location</strong>&nbsp;screen is displayed.</span>
</p>
<div class="note_new">
  <div class="note_new_left">Note</div>
  <div class="note_new_right">
    <p>&nbsp;If <strong>Install to Archive</strong> was selected on the <strong>Environment Destination</strong> screen, the Configure Environment&nbsp;screen will be displayed instead.&nbsp;</p>
  </div>
</div>
<h2 id="Anchor_204982399_h2_5">3. Choose Location</h2>
<p>
  <img src="../Attachments/Attach_204982399/246235477.png" width="500" />
</p>
<p class="p">In this step, you enter the base installation directory for the environment that you want to create. The fields are as follows.</p>
<ul class="ul">
  <li class="li">
    <strong>Location:</strong>&nbsp;The directory location where the environment is created.&nbsp;</li>
  <li class="li">
    <strong>Name:</strong>&nbsp;The name that the environment is referred to by NDI.</li>
</ul>
<div class="info_new">
  <div class="info_new_left">Info</div>
  <div class="info_new_right">
    <ul>
      <li>An ideal&nbsp;name for your environment may be one that is similar to the project you are working on. You should not use a name based on the version of an SDK you are installing. This is because when you update it in the future, the version number of the SDK will change.</li>
      <li>Two environments with the same name cannot&nbsp;reside in the same location.</li>
      <li>The final installation path for the environment is a combination of the Location and Name fields. The Location is used as the base path, and the Name is used as an additional path underneath the Location. For example, an environment with the Name <strong>Environment</strong> and the Location <strong>C:\NDI_Environments,</strong> would have an installation path of <strong>C:\NDI_Environments\Environment</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>
<p class="p">If there is a conflict with the name of the environment entered, an error message appears informing you of the issue.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_204982399_h2_6">4. Configure Environment</h2>
<p>In this step, you&nbsp;choose the software packages that are installed when initially creating your environment.&nbsp;Not all&nbsp;packages are required, and&nbsp;you may choose to install other packages&nbsp;at a later time. You&nbsp;can select packages in two different ways: by&nbsp;<strong>Bundle Selection</strong>&nbsp;or through&nbsp;<strong>Detailed Package Management</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="Anchor_204982399_h3_6">Bundle Selection</h3>
<p class="p">Initially, you are presented with the&nbsp;<strong>Bundle&nbsp;Selection</strong>&nbsp;screen, as shown below.</p>
<p class="p">
  <img src="../Attachments/Attach_204982399/246235479.png" width="500" />
</p>
<p>The individual selections on this screen represent software packages that have been grouped together for&nbsp;a specific purpose. This might be because they are useful to a particular development role, such as Artist&nbsp;or Tester, or because the software has interdependent features. These bundles are intended to help you&nbsp;make selections&nbsp;of the&nbsp;packages you wish to install. You may select any combination of bundles, or&nbsp;one bundle individually, to suit your development needs. Click a bundle to select or deselect it.</p>
<p>Click the&nbsp;<strong>Details</strong>&nbsp;link to open a window with more information on the software packages that are&nbsp;included in the bundle.</p>
<p class="p">
  <img src="../Attachments/Attach_204982399/246235481.png" width="500" />
</p>
<p class="p">Click the&nbsp;<strong>Next</strong>&nbsp;button in the lower right corner&nbsp;to display a list of all packages that have been selected, including file size. From this screen, click&nbsp;<strong>Install&nbsp;</strong>to&nbsp;begin installation of all packages from the selected bundles.&nbsp;If no bundles are selected, only the software packages required by the foundation and tool set (if applicable) are installed.</p>
<p class="p">&nbsp;</p>
<div class="section">
  <h3 id="Anchor_204982399_h3_7">Detailed Package Management</h3>
  <p class="p">Instead of installing packages based on bundles, you can make choices about&nbsp;the packages that will be installed to your environment. To start this process, click the <strong class="ph b">Detailed Package Management</strong>&nbsp;button. Any packages belonging to bundles that have been selected, will automatically be set to install on the following package selection screen. For more information&nbsp;about detailed package selection, see the <a href="../Pages/Page_204982462.html">3.1.4 Custom Package Selection</a>&nbsp;section.</p>
  <h3 id="Anchor_204982399_h3_8">EULA</h3>
  <p>Some packages selected for installation&nbsp;have an End User License Agreement (EULA) that you will need to review. The EULAs&nbsp;are displayed when you click&nbsp;<strong>Install</strong><em>&nbsp;</em>and must be accepted for the associated&nbsp;software to begin installation.&nbsp;After a package has been installed, you only need to accept the EULA again if you delete the software from all environments on your system.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<h2 id="Anchor_204982399_h2_7">5. Installing Packages</h2>
<p class="p">When you have specified the packages that you want to install, the download and installation process begins.</p>
<p class="p">The download process indicates the progress of individual packages as they are downloaded from the server. Packages that have been previously downloaded and saved to the cache will not be redownloaded.&nbsp;The following&nbsp;is a screen&nbsp;that shows&nbsp;the beginning of the download process.</p>
<p class="p">
  <img src="../Attachments/Attach_204982399/246235472.PNG" width="500" />
</p>
<p class="p">After all packages have been downloaded, they&nbsp;are then installed. The following&nbsp;is a screen showing that packages have&nbsp;started installing while others are still waiting to be installed.</p>
<p class="p">
  <img src="../Attachments/Attach_204982399/246235474.PNG" width="500" />
</p>
<p class="p">When all packages have finished installing, the&nbsp;<strong class="ph b">Finish</strong>&nbsp;button becomes selectable. Click&nbsp;<strong class="ph b">Finish</strong>&nbsp;to return to the Welcome screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p">&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<h1 style="margin-left: 14.0px;" id="Anchor_204982399_h1_2">Install to Archive</h1>
<p>If you have chosen to create a MegaZarf archive, you are presented with the following screen.</p>
<p>
  <img src="../Attachments/Attach_204982399/246235490.png" width="500" />
</p>
<p class="p">In this step, you enter information about the MegaZarf file that will be created. A MegaZarf file contains all the information required for any instance of NDI to recreate the environment it contains.</p>
<p class="p">To create a MegaZarf, the following information must be provided.</p>
<ul class="ul">
  <li class="li">
    <strong class="ph b">Export File Name:</strong>&nbsp;The name for the MegaZarf file.</li>
  <li class="li">
    <strong class="ph b">Export Path:</strong>&nbsp;The location on the file system that the MegaZarf&nbsp;is saved to.</li>
  <li class="li">
    <strong class="ph b">Description:</strong>&nbsp;A text description that is included with the MegaZarf file.</li>
  <li class="li">
    <strong class="ph b">Include all software binaries in the exported file:</strong>&nbsp;If checked, the MegaZarf contains all files to build the contained environment while offline. This greatly increases the file size of the MegaZarf, based on the number and size of packages in the environment. If unchecked, only the metadata required to create the environment is exported. In this case, NDI may prompt consumers of the MegaZarf to connect to Nintendo to download the files required for installation.&nbsp;</li>
  <li class="li">
    <strong class="ph b">Environment Name:</strong>&nbsp;The name of the environment that is being created.</li>
  <li class="li">
    <strong class="ph b">Allow overriding name:</strong>&nbsp;If checked, a user that creates an environment from the MegaZarf is able to choose a different name for the environment than the one you specify.</li>
  <li class="li">
    <strong class="ph b">Environment Location:</strong>&nbsp;The file system location of the environment that is being created.</li>
  <li class="li">
    <strong class="ph b">Allow overriding path location:</strong>&nbsp;If checked, a user that creates an environment from this MegaZarf is able to choose another directory location to install the environment than the one you specify.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">After entering all required information, click&nbsp;<strong class="ph b">Next</strong>&nbsp;in the lower right corner to continue. For more information, return to step 1 <em>Define New Environment</em> earlier in this section. As you continue, step 3 <em>Choose Location</em> is omitted from the environment creation process.</p>
