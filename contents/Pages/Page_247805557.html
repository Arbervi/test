<p>This screen is used to&nbsp;view information about environments which have been previously created using Nintendo Dev Interface (NDI). In addition, new environments may be created and existing environments may be altered.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>New Environment</strong>&nbsp;button in the upper left corner of the screen begins the process of creating a new environment.</p>
<p>The environment list on the left displays all environments currently installed to the system. Select an environment and information about that environment is displayed on the right. The key details of an&nbsp;environment are as follows.</p>
<ul>
  <li class="li">
    <strong class="ph b">Name:</strong>&nbsp;The name of the environment used by NDI.</li>
  <li class="li">
    <strong class="ph b">Foundation:</strong>&nbsp;The foundation that is installed for the environment, including the currently installed version.</li>
  <li class="li">
    <strong class="ph b">Location:</strong>&nbsp;The location of the environment in the file system.&nbsp;Select the blue folder icon&nbsp;to open the file location for the selected environment.</li>
  <li class="li">

</ul>
<h1 id="Anchor_247805557_h1_1">Updates</h1>
<p>After an environment is created, new versions of the packages that were initially installed will become available. When this occurs, the following icon&nbsp;is displayed,&nbsp;adjacent to the name of the environment.</p>
<p>

<h3 id="Anchor_247805557_h3_2">Installation Summary</h3>
<p class="p">This screen displays all packages to be installed when continuing the update process. The name, version to be installed, and size of each package is displayed. The total space required for the installation is displayed in the lower right corner of the screen.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_247805557_h2_2">Open in Explorer</h2>
<p>This option opens a new Windows Explorer window at the system location for the environment.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_247805557_h2_3">Delete</h2>
<p>This option removes the selected environment from the system. After the environment is deleted, if there are no other environments on the system, a prompt to remove all remaining global packages from the system will be displayed.</p>
<div class="info_new">
  <div class="info_new_left">Info</div>
  <div class="info_new_right">
    <p>Global Packages are software packages that are only installed one time, but can be used by all environments on the system.</p>

<h2 id="Anchor_247805557_h2_4">Export</h2>
<p>This option allows you to create a MegaZarf file from the selected environment. An exported MegaZarf file contains all of the information required for any instance of NDI to create the environment again.</p>
<div class="info_new">
  <div class="info_new_left">Info</div>
  <div class="info_new_right">

<p class="p">To create a MegaZarf, the following information must be entered.</p>
<ul class="ul">
  <li class="li">
    <strong class="ph b">Export File Name:</strong>&nbsp;The name for the MegaZarf file.</li>
  <li class="li">

    <strong class="ph b">Description:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;A text description that is included with the MegaZarf file.</li>
  <li class="li">
    <strong class="ph b">Include all software binaries in the exported file:</strong>&nbsp;If selected, the MegaZarf will contain all files to build the contained environment while offline. This will greatly increase the file size of the MegaZarf, based on the number and size of packages in the environment. If cleared, only the metadata required to create the environment is exported. In this case, NDI may prompt consumers of the MegaZarf to connect to Nintendo to download files required for installation.&nbsp;</li>
  <li class="li">
    <strong class="ph b">Environment Name</strong>&nbsp;(Unmodifiable): The name of the environment that is being exported.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="Anchor_247805557_h2_5">Update</h2>
<p>This option attempts to update all packages in the selected environment to their latest available package that shares a major and minor version, if any (in example,&nbsp;<em>2.1.0</em>&nbsp;will update to&nbsp;<em>2.1.2</em>, but not to&nbsp;<em>2.2.0</em>). It opens a window that lists all available&nbsp;updates for installed packages and the total file size of the packages that will be downloaded and installed.</p>
<div class="note_new">
  <div class="note_new_left">Note</div>
  <div class="note_new_right">
    <p>If updates are available for an environment, all indicated software packages will be installed. When updating in this manner, you cannot choose individual updates to perform. It is possible to perform updates on individual packages using the Manage Details feature and making selections there.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<p>Click the&nbsp;<strong>Update</strong>&nbsp;button to begin the update proccess for the environment. This may take several minutes, depending on the&nbsp;size and number of updates required.</p>
<p>
  <br />
</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_247805557_h2_6">Set as Default</h2>
<p>This option displays differently depending on which platforms&nbsp;the foundation in the environment supports. If an environment supports multiple platforms, an individual&nbsp;<strong>Set as Default</strong>&nbsp;option is displayed for each platform.</p>
<p>Selecting this option for an environment causes it to be the default environment for software that interacts with the indicated platform. Additionally, selecting this option for an environment makes it the default&nbsp;SDK path to use in the NDI Command-line interface. For more&nbsp;information, see the NDI Command-line documentation.</p>
<p>This default setting may be removed by selecting the&nbsp;<strong>Clear as Default</strong>&nbsp;option, which replaces&nbsp;<strong>Set&nbsp;as Default</strong>&nbsp;in the menu for default environments. Only a single environment can be set as default for a given&nbsp;platform.</p>
<h2 id="Anchor_247805557_h2_7">Environment Information</h2>
<p>This option displays all information about the environment in a format that may be selected for copy and paste operations. This is the same information available in other parts of the application, collected in one location for easy access.</p>
