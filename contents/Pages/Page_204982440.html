  <p>This screen is used to&nbsp;view information about environments that&nbsp;you have previously created using NDI. In addition, you may create new environments and perform other&nbsp;actions related to installed environments.&nbsp;Information about&nbsp;performing each of these options is covered later&nbsp;in this section.</p>
  <p>Click&nbsp;the&nbsp;<strong>New Environment</strong>&nbsp;button&nbsp;to begin the process of creating a new environment, as detailed in the&nbsp;<a href="../Pages/Page_204982394.html">Development Environments Tool </a>section.</p>
  <p>The environment list on the left displays all environments currently installed to your system. Select&nbsp;an environment&nbsp;to display information about that environment on the right. The key details of an&nbsp;environment are:</p>
  <ul class="ul">
    <li class="li">
      <strong class="ph b">Name:</strong>&nbsp;The name of the environment used by NDI.</li>
    <li class="li">
      <strong class="ph b">Foundation:</strong>&nbsp;The foundation that is installed for the environment, including the currently installed version.</li>
    <li class="li">
      <strong class="ph b">Location:</strong>&nbsp;The location of the environment in the file system.</li>
    <li class="li">
      <strong>Installed Releases List:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;A list of all software packages installed to the environment and their&nbsp;current version.&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="info_new">
    <div class="info_new_left">Info</div>
    <div class="info_new_right">
      <p>Click the blue folder icon, under the environment name,&nbsp;to open the file location for the selected environment.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h2 style="margin-left: 14.0px;" id="Anchor_204982440_h2_1">Updates</h2>
  <p>Many times, after you create an environment, new versions of the packages that you&nbsp;initially installed will become available. When this occurs, the following icon&nbsp;is displayed,&nbsp;adjacent to the name of the environment.</p>
  <p>
    <img src="../Attachments/Attach_204982440/241556723.png" />
  </p>
  <p>For more information&nbsp;about updating environments, refer to the&nbsp;<em>Update</em>&nbsp;section below.</p>
  <h2 style="margin-left: 14.0px;" id="Anchor_204982440_h2_2">Dashboard Groups and Favorites</h2>
  <p>Dashboard Groups are installed with specific packages and enable quick access to particular functions,&nbsp;such as updating hardware, opening specific programs, or installing additional packages.</p>
  <p>Dashboard functions that you might regularly use, can be selected as favorites, adding them to the Welcome screen for ease of&nbsp;access. To favorite a dashboard function, click the star icon to the right of the desired selection.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Once a favorite has been added, it is displayed in a new tool on the Welcome screen. To remove a&nbsp;favorite, click the star icon next to it.</p>
  <h2 style="margin-left: 14.0px;" id="Anchor_204982440_h2_3">Manage</h2>
  <p>The Manage button is visible in the upper right of the screen.</p>
  <p>
    <img src="../Attachments/Attach_204982440/241556724.png" />
  </p>
  <p>Click the <strong>Manage</strong> button to&nbsp;access a drop-down list box with the following options.</p>
  <h3 id="Anchor_204982440_h3_1">Manage Details</h3>
  <p>
    <img src="../Attachments/Attach_204982440/241556716.png" width="500" />
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 60.0px;">Select&nbsp;<strong>Manage Details</strong>&nbsp;to open the <strong>Configure Environment</strong> screen. This screen&nbsp;allows you to make&nbsp;modifications to specific packages you have installed, or install additional packages to your environment.&nbsp;For more information, see the&nbsp;<a href="../Pages/Page_204982462.html">Environment Configuration</a>&nbsp;section.</p>
  <h3 id="Anchor_204982440_h3_2">Open in Explorer</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 60.0px;">From the <strong>manage</strong> menu, select <strong>Open in Explorer</strong>&nbsp;to open a new Explorer window at the system location for the environment.</p>
  <h3 id="Anchor_204982440_h3_3">Delete</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 60.0px;">From the <strong>manage</strong> menu, select&nbsp;<strong>Delete</strong>&nbsp;to remove the selected environment from your system. After the environment is deleted, if there are no other environments on your system, you will also be asked if you want to remove all remaining Global Packages from your system.</p>
  <div class="info_new">
    <div class="info_new_left">Info</div>
    <div class="info_new_right">
      <p>Global Packages are software packages that are only installed one time, but can be used by all environments on your system.</p>

  <h3 id="Anchor_204982440_h3_4">Export</h3>
  <p>
    <img src="../Attachments/Attach_204982440/241556718.png" width="500" />
  </p>
  <p class="p">From the <strong>manage</strong> menu, select&nbsp;<strong>Export</strong>&nbsp;to create a MegaZarf file from the selected environment. An exported MegaZarf file contains all the information required for any instance of NDI to recreate the environment.</p>
  <div class="info_new">
    <div class="info_new_left">Info</div>
    <div class="info_new_right">
      <p>The approximate file size of the of the MegaZarf will be displayed at the top of the screen. Please ensure that you have sufficient space to create the file.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p class="p">To create a MegaZarf, the following information must be provided.</p>
  <ul class="ul">
    <li class="li">
      <strong class="ph b">Export File Name:</strong>&nbsp;The name for the MegaZarf file.</li>
    <li class="li">
      <strong class="ph b">Export Path:</strong>&nbsp;The location on the file system that the MegaZarf is saved to.</li>
    <li class="li">
      <strong class="ph b">Description:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;A text description that&nbsp;is included with the MegaZarf file.</li>
    <li class="li">
      <strong class="ph b">Include all software binaries in the exported file:</strong>&nbsp;If checked, the MegaZarf contains all files to build the contained environment while offline. This greatly increases the filesize of the MegaZarf, based on the number and size of packages in the environment. If unchecked, only the metadata required to create the environment&nbsp;is exported. In such a case, NDI may prompt consumers of the MegaZarf to connect to Nintendo to download files required for installation.&nbsp;</li>
    <li class="li">
      <strong>Environment Name&nbsp;(Unmodifiable):</strong> The name of the environment that is being exported.</li>
    <li class="li">
      <strong class="ph b">Allow overriding name:</strong>&nbsp;If checked, a user that creates an environment from the MegaZarf&nbsp;is able to choose another name for the environment than the one you specify.</li>
    <li class="li">
      <strong>Environment Location&nbsp;(Unmodifiable):</strong> The file system location of the environment that is being exported.</li>
    <li class="li">
      <strong class="ph b">Allow overriding path location:</strong>&nbsp;If checked, a user that creates an environment from this MegaZarf the&nbsp;is able to choose another directory location to install the environment than the one you specify.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="Anchor_204982440_h3_5">Update</h3>
  <p>If you select&nbsp;<strong>Update</strong>&nbsp;from the <strong>manage</strong> menu, it causes the selected environment to update to the latest&nbsp;versions of packages that are currently installed, if any. This opens a window that lists all available&nbsp;updates for installed packages, and the total file size of the packages that will be downloaded and installed.</p>
  <div class="note_new">
    <div class="note_new_left">Note</div>
    <div class="note_new_right">
      <p>If updates are available for an environment, all indicated software packages will be installed. When updating in this manner, there is no&nbsp;method to choose individual updates to perform.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Click the&nbsp;<strong>Update</strong>&nbsp;button&nbsp;to install the new versions of the software to the environment. This may take several minutes, depending on the&nbsp;size and number of updates required.</p>
  <p>Instead, you may perform updates on individual packages. To do so, go to the <strong>Manage Details</strong> screen (by&nbsp;selecting the <strong>Manage Details</strong> option from the <strong>manage</strong> menu), then make individual selections. For&nbsp;more information,&nbsp;see the <em>Manage Details</em>&nbsp;section.</p>
  <h3 id="Anchor_204982440_h3_6">Set as Default</h3>
  <p>From&nbsp;the <strong>manage</strong> menu, the&nbsp;<strong>Set as Default</strong>&nbsp;option displays differently depending on which platforms&nbsp;the foundation in the environment supports. If an environment supports multiple platforms, an individual&nbsp;<strong>Set as Default</strong>&nbsp;option will be displayed for each platform.</p>
  <p>Selecting this option for an environment causes it to be the default environment for software that interacts with the indicated platform. Additionally, selecting this option for an environment makes it the default&nbsp;SDK path for use in the NDI command-line interface. For more&nbsp;information, see the <em>NDI Command-line</em> documentation.</p>
  <p>You may also remove this default setting by selecting the&nbsp;<strong>Clear as Default</strong>&nbsp;option, which replaces&nbsp;<strong>Set&nbsp;as Default</strong>&nbsp;in the menu for default environments.&nbsp; <strong>Note:</strong> Only a single environment can be set as default for a given&nbsp;platform.</p>
  <h3 id="Anchor_204982440_h3_7">Environment Information</h3>
  <p>From the <strong>manage</strong> menu, select&nbsp;<strong>Environment Information</strong>&nbsp;to display all information about the environment in a format that may be selected for copy and paste operations. This is the same information available in other&nbsp;areas of the application, collected into one location for easy access.</p>
